  <p> Aside from its <em>delicious</em> cuisine, Italy is home to a few of the most <em> sublime monuments</em> and <em>intricate artworks </em>. Personally, two weeks was not enough time to explore every nook and cranny of Italy, but I have compiled the most famous tourist attractions to visit during a short period of time! </p>
  <br/>
  <h1>1. A visit to the Duomo di Milano</h1>
  <p>Located in Milan, the Dumo is largely recognized by tourists as the #1 cathedral you must visit when travelling around Italy. Not only is it the largest cathedral in Europe, but it also symbolizes Italians respect and gratitude towards the Divine.</p>

  <div class="italy-float1">
    <p> When I first visited the Cathedral, I was greeted by local tour-guides who looking to show tourists around the Cathedral. You can also find <a href="http://www.duomomilano.it/en/infopage/ticket-offices/23748cfe-62de-4da2-a919-872d4d5db551/">two ticket-stands</a> in the main area. A standard tour consists of a quick walk inside the Duomo through which you can admire its stain-glass windows and intricate architecture.</p>
    <p> Once you've admired its interior design, I highly recommend visiting the rooftop of the Cathedral, where you can see an incredible view of Milan stretching out into the horizon. There are tall metalic gates surrounding the entire rooftop area, so there is no need to be worried about a lack of safety measures!</p>
    <p> As the Duomo gets very crowded throughout the day, I encourage you to visit it early in the morning. That way, you can avoid the crowd and admire the Cathedral's interior design in a spacious area.</p>

  <div class= "italy-float3">
    <p> There are many gondolas parked on the canal, welcoming locals and tourists for a quick ride through the water. Along the Canal, you'll see rows of colorful houses where the wealthies families of Venice live.</p>
    <p> You can also admire a few of Venice's most well-known bridges, such as the  <a href="http://europeforvisitors.com/venice/articles/rialto_bridge.htm">Rialoti Bridge</a> and the <a href="http://www.italiaoutdoors.com/index.php/755-regions-of-italy/italy-veneto-region/the-venice-venezia-province-italy/city-of-venice/venice-dorsoduro/1190-venice-accademia-bridge">Academic Bridge</a>.  I highly recomend the <a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Venice/Venice-Gondola-Ride-and-Serenade/d522-2495TOUR4/important-info">Venice Gondola Ride and Serenade Tour</a> that offers tourists a 35-minute ride through the entire canal. At a cost of only $49 USD, this is a very popular choice among foreign tourists. </p>
    <p> At venice, something worth doing is waking up early to see the sun rise. At every bridge, you will find a lot of locals and tourists gathered in one area to admire the golden skyline. I highly recommend you to bring your camera! </p>

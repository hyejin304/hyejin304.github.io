  <p> For the longest of time, Japan has been on my bucket-list. Last winter, I was lucky enough to go on a trip with my family to Hokkaido, the northern city of Japan. Hokkaido's <em>high mountains</em> offer an <em>incredible</em> area to ski and snowboard with friends or family. </p>
  <h1>1. Sapporo Beer Museum</h1>
  <p>For all you beer-lovers, this is a great place to visit. Opened in 1987, the museum offers its visitors a rich history of how the Sapporo beer has evolved. By the end of your visit, you can purchase Sapporo beers at a small cost. </p>

  <div class="sapporo-text">
    <p> At the museum, you not only learn about the history of beer-making, but you can also admire the process happening right infront of your eyes. The glass doors offers a 360 degrees view of what goes on inside the factory. The tour guides are well equipped with knowledge, so take this opportunity to ask them any questions you have! </p>
    <p> The museum is closed on Mondays and on public holidays. During the remaining days, they operate from 11:30am to 8pm, giving people a sufficient amount of time to admire the entire museum. Fortunately, the admission is free for all! However, if you want to go on a tour, you will have to pay approximately 500 Japanese Yen.</p>

  <h1>2. A Dip into the Noboribetsu Onsen</h1>
  <p>Not many people outside of Asia are familiar with <a href="https://www.insidejapantours.com/blog/2015/02/17/japanese-etiquette-101-how-to-onsen/">Onsens</a>. These hot springs are very popular among Japanese people.</p>

  <div class="onsen-text">
    <p>In Hokkaido, the <a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6752.html">Noboribetsu</a> is the most famous onsen, and can be quite crowded with both locals and tourists. They provide 11 different kinds with varying temperatures. Depending on what temperature you prefer, you can freely move about and explore.</p>
    <p> It takes approximtely one hour to travel from Sapporo to Noboribetsu at a cost of 4000 yen via the <a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2016.html">limited express train</a>. On the other hand, you can also visit the onsen via local trains at a much lower cost (2160 yen). </p>

  <div class= "ski-text">
    <p> The resort is conveniently located in the very center of Hokkaido. During the winter, the snow tends to be a lot more dry in this area, which makes room for a much safer area to snowboard/ski in. What makes this resort so unique is that it offers people with more than just ski-ing services. You can also find a variety of activities such as tree-riding and guided tours. </p>

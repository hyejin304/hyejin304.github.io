  <p id="home-body"> As an <em>avid</em> traveller, I have compiled a list of places I've visited over the past few years, along with the most famous tourist attractions.
    I believe that travelling shouldn't be a luxury. It should be an option for <em>everyone</em> of various income brackets. Thus, I have also offered you with tips and tricks to save costs while travelling to the most <em>exotic</em> places around the world. </p>
